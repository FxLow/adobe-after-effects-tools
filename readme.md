About this project
This repository collects tools that help you work more efficiently inside Adobe After Effects. The focus is on three pillars: motion graphics, keying, and tracking. You’ll find a mix of scripts that automate repetitive steps, presets that standardize color work and matte creation, and templates that speed up the setup of new projects. The goal is to reduce the time you spend on rote tasks so you can focus on creative decisions.

What you get
- ExtendScript and JavaScript tools that you can run from the After Effects scripting panel or as part of a project workflow
- FX templates and precomposed setups to jump-start common scenes
- Presets for color correction, matte extraction, edge refinement, and tracking confidence
- A lightweight UI panel that exposes core functions in a single place
- Documentation and examples that explain how to adapt the tools to your pipeline

How it works
The tools are designed to play well with standard After Effects projects. They do not replace core features but extend them with helpful wrappers and automations. Most tools are implemented as:
- Scripts you run from the After Effects UI or via the Script Launcher
- Projects and templates you can import into a new or existing composition
- Presets you apply to layers, effects, or tracks
- Small panels that provide one-click access to common actions

This approach keeps things predictable and easy to audit. You can inspect the code, modify it if you need to adapt to your workflow, and share improvements with your team.

Getting started
If you are new to After Effects scripting, this project provides a gentle entry point. You can start by exploring the presets and templates, then move into scripts as you become more comfortable with ExtendScript and the After Effects scripting model. The examples are built to be approachable for both newcomers and seasoned artists.

Prerequisites
- A workstation with Adobe After Effects installed
- A recent version of After Effects (CC 2020+ recommended for best compatibility)
- A basic understanding of layers, masks, and keying concepts
- Access to the repository’s releases to download installers and assets

Installation guide
This project distributes assets via the Releases page. From the page, download the latest installer or asset package and run it on your workstation. The Windows installer is typically named adobe-after-effects-tools-windows.exe and the macOS package is adobe-after-effects-tools-macos.dmg. For Linux users, a lightweight option may be provided as a script or not supported; consult the Releases page for platform availability.

Downloads
From the Releases page, download the latest asset package. Run the installer to install tools into After Effects, or extract templates into your project. The exact file names may vary by release, but the process remains the same: obtain the installer, run it, and follow the on-screen prompts. For convenience, you can visit the Releases page directly or use the button below to jump there.

Quick start: a practical first run
1. Install the tools from the releases page. Choose the installer suitable for your OS and follow the prompts.
2. Open After Effects and verify the new tools appear in the Window > Extensions (or the Scripts panel, depending on how you installed them).
3. Create a simple composition: 1920x1080, 24 fps, 5 seconds long.
4. Import a sample clip that demonstrates keying or tracking. If you don’t have a clip handy, use a public domain stock clip for practice.
5. Try the basic keying workflow: apply the keying preset, adjust threshold and spill suppression, refine edges, and evaluate the matte in the alpha channel.
6. Try the tracking workflow: set up a scene, apply the tracking tool, and bind the tracked data to a target layer (such as a mask, a solid, or a 3D layer).
7. Save your project and note how the tools simplify repetitive steps.

Tip: If you run into a problem during installation, revisit the Release notes for any platform-specific considerations or prerequisites. The Release notes also describe version-specific changes and known issues.

Core workflows

Keying workflow
Keying is essential for clean composites in motion graphics and VFX. The goal is to separate subjects from their background with a matte that is accurate and free of color spill or edge artifacts. The keying workflow in this project emphasizes:
- A robust hue-based key with adjustable tolerance
- Spill suppression in a controlled pass
- Edge relief for soft, natural edges on hair and fine details
- Matte refinement using feathering, choke, and contract controls
- Quick preview modes to assess matte quality in real time

Steps to perform a typical keying task
- Prepare your source: ensure lighting is consistent and the subject is well separated from the background.
- Apply the keying preset: choose the preset that matches your footage (green screen, blue screen, or vignette-based keying).
- Adjust tolerance and edge controls: refine the core key while preserving fine details.
- Refine the matte: activate edge refinement, feathering, and choke to improve the transition between the subject and the background.
- View the matte: toggle the alpha channel view to confirm the key quality across the whole frame.
- Add a background: place your new background layer behind the keyed subject, and fine-tune the composite.

Tips for effective keying
- Shoot with a clean and evenly lit backdrop to minimize spill and shadows.
- Use edge refiners sparingly; too much feathering can cause halos and soft edges.
- For hair and fine details, consider a multi-pass approach: a rough key followed by a precise edge pass.
- Consider adding a light wrap to soften the boundary between subject and background.

Tracking workflow
Tracking helps you maintain believable relationships between elements in a scene. This project includes tools to streamline:
- Planar and point tracking
- Stabilization workflows for shaky footage
- Tracking data assignment to masks, shapes, or null objects
- Reuse of tracking data across multiple layers or scenes
- Visual feedback to confirm tracking quality

Steps to perform a typical tracking task
- Choose the right tracker for the scene: point tracker for relatively flat scenes; 3D camera tracker for more complex shots.
- Set anchor points and track points with good coverage across movement.
- Review tracking results, fix drift or mis-tracked frames, and refine as needed.
- Apply tracking data to the target layer or null object to drive motion or effects.
- Integrate tracked data with other effects, such as stabilization or masking.

Practical tips for reliable tracking
- Use high-contrast tracking points and avoid repetitive textures.
- Track over longer clips in chunks if the scene changes significantly.
- Manually adjust key frames where automatic tracking struggles, then resume auto-tracking.
- Dry-run each step to ensure consistency before committing the data to layers.

Automation and scripting
This repository emphasizes automation to reduce manual work. You’ll find:
- Script palettes that wrap common actions in a single click
- Custom panels that expose multiple functions in a unified interface
- Lightweight utilities for batch processing within a project
- Example scripts that demonstrate how to chain actions for faster workflows

Examples of automated tasks
- Automatically create a precomposed composition for a scene with a masked subject
- Batch apply keying presets to a set of layers
- Automatically stabilize a clip, then reframe the shot for consistent composition
- Generate a control layer with sliders to drive color corrections across multiple layers

How to use scripts
- Open After Effects and access the Scripts panel
- Locate the script you want to run, or install it via the provided installer
- Select the layers or items you want to affect
- Run the script and follow on-screen prompts if available
- If a script exposes a UI, interact with the controls to fine-tune results

Templates and presets
Templates and presets offer quick-start options for many common tasks. They help you:
- Set up a project with a ready-made layout
- Apply consistent color grades and keying parameters
- Create a reusable layout for tracking and stabilization
- Save your favorite combinations for future projects

Examples of templates you might find
- A standard shot-reveal template with a keyed subject and a dynamic background
- A tracking-driven parallax template that creates depth
- A modular lower-third package with ready-to-edit text layers and motion
- A multi-shot composite template that assembles a scene with consistent lighting and color

Templates and presets usage tips
- Start with a template to ensure structure and consistency
- Customize presets to match your camera, lighting, and color pipeline
- Save your modifications as new presets to reuse across projects
- Keep templates lightweight to preserve performance in large projects
